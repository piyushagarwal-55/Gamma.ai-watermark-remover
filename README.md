## 🌟 What is Gamma AI Watermark Remover?

A specialized web application designed to remove **gamma.app** watermarks from PDF files. This tool specifically targets Gamma AI's branding elements that appear in PDFs exported from their free tier, helping you create clean, professional-looking documents.

## 🤔 Why do you need it?

Gamma AI is a fantastic presentation tool, but the watermarks in the free version can be problematic for professional and educational use:

* **Professional Presentations:** Remove distracting branding for business meetings and formal presentations
* **Educational Materials:** Create clean study materials and academic presentations  
* **Portfolio Work:** Present your content without third-party branding
* **Document Clarity:** Improve focus and readability by removing visual distractions

## ⚙️ How does it work?

The application uses an intelligent detection and removal system:

1. **PDF Analysis:** Parses PDF documents page by page using PyMuPDF (fitz)
2. **Targeted Detection:** Identifies gamma.app watermarks by analyzing images positioned in the bottom-right corner and links pointing to gamma.app domain
3. **Smart Removal:** Removes detected watermarks while preserving document integrity
4. **Clean Output:** Generates a watermark-free PDF ready for professional use

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

1. Open two terminal windows
2. In the first terminal, run the backend:
   ```bash
   python api.py
   ```
3. In the second terminal, run the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

4. **Access the Web Interface:**
   Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:3000`

5. **Upload and Process:**
   - Click "Choose PDF File" to select your Gamma AI PDF
   - Click "Remove Watermark" to process the file
   - Download the clean PDF automatically
